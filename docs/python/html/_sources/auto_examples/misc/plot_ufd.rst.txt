Union-Find Data Structure
================================

The wikipedia definition of union find data structure is excellent
therefore we will just cite it here:

    In computer science, 
    a disjoint-set data structure, 
    also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, 
    is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements 
    partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. 
    It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the inverse Ackermann function) to add new sets, 
    to merge existing sets, 
    and to determine whether elements are in the same set. In addition to many other uses (see the Applications section), 
    disjoint-sets play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

In this example we show how to use a fast UFD implementation.
