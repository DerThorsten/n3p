The documentation is split into 3 parts:

    *   The documentation:
        Auto generated API reference can be confusing 
        for beginners. 
        This is even more true for python libraries which
        use pybind11 or boost::python to export C++  to python.
        If the C++ code heavily relies on templates the auto generated
        documentation is full of complicated  ``template`` names.
        Therefore we try to add es many examples and hand written
        documentation to improve the user experience.

    *   Examples:
        TODO
    *   The API Reference documentation:
        TODO
