Multicut Theory

Material
^^^^^^^^^

Here is a list of good talks, slides, pdfs and any other good
material which is related to the lifted mutlticut problem:




*   :cite:`kappes_11_globally` is one of the first papers
    using the multicut objective for computer vision.
    :cite:`kappes_11_globally` explain in great detail
    how to solve multicut problems to optimality.

    *   `Paper <http://ipa.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/ipabib/Papers/kappes-emmcvpr2011.pdf>`_
  
*   :cite:`andres_2011_probabilistic` is one of the first papers
    using a multicut objective for image segmentation.
    In fact, a higher order multicut is optimized in :cite:`andres_2011_probabilistic`.
    Nevertheless, it can helpful to understand the concept
    of the multicut objective.
    The paper contains very illustrative figures.

*   The material from :cite:`beier_14_cut` is very useful
    to understand the cut-glue and cut solver, furthermore
    it  can be helpful to understand the multicut objective itself.

    *   `Conference Talk <http://techtalks.tv/talks/cut-glue-cut-a-fast-approximate-solver-for-multicut-partitioning/60246/>`_

*   The material from :cite:`beier_16_efficient` is not only  a good introduction to the lifted multicut objective
    but also to the ordinary multicut objective.
    The difference between the multicut objective and the lifted multicut objective is illustrated:
